Container image signing is an important layer of a defense-in-depth approach to protecting Kubernetes clusters (and the systems and data they can access) from malicious actors. By enforcing container signing policies in Kubernetes clusters, organizations benefit from a cryptographically verified assertion of the integrity of a container image and, optionally, that the container image meets certain conditions required for running in a given environment...","title":"Signed container images in Kubernetes with Sigstore and HashiCorp Vault"},{"feedAuthor":"jbowdre","feedTitle":"srs bsns (lol)","firstFetched":"2024-11-11T20:04:34.864438076Z","homepage":"https://srsbsns.lol/","link":"https://srsbsns.lol/this-week-2024-11-10/","published":"2024-11-11T19:30:00Z","summary":"\"A day late / a post short / I'm writing / last week's report\"","title":"This Week (2024-11-10)"}]
